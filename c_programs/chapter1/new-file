int is an integer, where float has a fractional part. Usually float is 32 bit with 6 significant digits.

char: single byte
short: short integer (?)
long: integer?
double: double precision floating point

Statements terminated by ;.

C programs don't care about indentation.

Why 5/9? Integer division is truncated, so if you wrote 5/9 it would evaluate to 0 as the fractional part would be discarded.

With printf(%d\t%d\n, foo, bar), the first %d corresponds to foo and the second %d corresponds to bar. The %d means to print the variable as an int (%s would be a string).

\t is a tab character.

If a math operator operand has one float and one int, the int is converted to a float

Use #define to define symbolic constants so you don't have "magic" numbers in your program that don't have any meaning to other programmers.

getchar() != EOF doesn't return boolean like in JavaScript:
if getchar() == EOF, it returns 0.
if getshar() != EOF, it returns 1.

## Question: 
Why does a while(1) evaluate to true and while(0) evaluate to false?
